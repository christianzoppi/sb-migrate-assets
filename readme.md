### About
This script can be used to migrate assets from a space to a cloned space, in order to have the assets stored in the cloned one. 
Once all the assets are stored in the target space, the script will replace the url of the assets in the entries of that space and it'll update them keeping the correct publish/unpublish status.

### Installation
Run `npm i` 

### Usage
Run `npm run start` and provide a OAUTH code from your account, the id of the source space and the id of the target space.
